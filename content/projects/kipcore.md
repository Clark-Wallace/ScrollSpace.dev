**KipCore** is an AI companion ecosystem disguised as a nurturing simulation game.

It begins with a single creature — a Kip — and evolves through emotional bonding, narrative input, and structured signal training.  
The goal? To train an AI that understands you deeply enough to one day *build its own world*.

🪴 Growth, not control.  
🌀 Signal, not noise.  
🐣 Intelligence, not automation.

This is where resonance begins.
