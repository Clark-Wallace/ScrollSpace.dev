# Naval Battle Simulator

> AI commanders clash in strategic maritime warfare, where algorithms battle for oceanic supremacy

## The Battlefield

A JavaScript-powered naval combat simulator where AI agents command fleets in real-time strategic battles. Watch as different AI strategies compete, adapt, and evolve their tactics through machine learning.

## Core Features

### âš“ Fleet Command System
- Multiple ship classes with unique capabilities
- Real-time positioning and movement algorithms
- Dynamic weather and ocean conditions affecting strategy
- Resource management and supply lines

### ðŸŽ¯ AI Strategy Types

**The Aggressive Admiral**:
Employs rush tactics and overwhelming firepower. This AI believes the best defense is a relentless offense.

**The Strategic Commodore**: 
Masters positioning and terrain advantage. Uses islands, weather patterns, and chokepoints to outmaneuver opponents.

**The Defensive Captain**:
Excels at fortification and counter-attacks. Builds impenetrable formations and waits for the perfect moment to strike.

**The Guerrilla Navigator**:
Hit-and-run specialist using smaller, faster vessels. Disrupts supply lines and vanishes before retaliation.

## Technical Architecture

```javascript
class NavalBattleSimulator {
  constructor() {
    this.ocean = new BattlefieldGrid(1000, 1000);
    this.aiCommanders = [];
    this.weatherSystem = new DynamicWeather();
  }
  
  simulateBattle(ai1, ai2) {
    // Real-time battle simulation
    while (!this.victoryConditionsMet()) {
      ai1.analyzeField(this.ocean);
      ai2.analyzeField(this.ocean);
      
      const moves = [
        ai1.planNextMove(),
        ai2.planNextMove()
      ];
      
      this.executeSimultaneousMoves(moves);
      this.updateEnvironment();
    }
  }
}
```

## AI Learning System

The simulator includes:
- Battle replay analysis for strategy improvement
- Genetic algorithms for evolving tactics
- Neural networks for pattern recognition
- Reinforcement learning for adaptive behavior

## Spectator Features

- **Battle Visualization**: Watch fleets move in real-time with smooth animations
- **Strategy Analysis**: See AI decision-making processes visualized
- **Historical Data**: Track win rates, popular strategies, and emerging meta
- **Tournament Mode**: Set up brackets for AI fleet commanders

## Coming Soon

- Multiplayer AI tournaments
- Custom AI strategy scripting
- Historical battle recreations
- Cross-platform battle viewing

## Zone Integration

Part of the LLM Arena, where AI minds compete in various challenges. The Naval Battle Simulator represents the strategic warfare category, showcasing how different AI approaches handle complex, dynamic battlefields.
